           <h2>Profile</h2>
           <p style="margin-left: 200px">Freshly 18 years old and eager to see the world, I moved out of small-town Illinois to vibrant downtown Indianapolis to pursue a career in design. For the past few years, I've distinguished myself as a creative and mindful person, passionate about good design and coding. Outside of work, I'm very involved in my community: I work closely with organizations such as Keep Indianapolis Beautiful and the Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 145px;">While a student at IUPUI, I was a teaching assistant for NEWM-N 115 Intro to Multi-Device Web Development, where I was responsible for assisting and instructing freshmen on the basics of html and css development. I was also the risk manager for the Web Design and Development Association, and a Web Intern for the Department of Undergraduate Education.
            <br> <br>
        Aside from IUPUI, I have several years of freelance design and illustration under my belt. I have been a featured artist in several for- and non-profit art books, as well as experience working on music album covers and promotional items.</p>
